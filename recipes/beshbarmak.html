    <p><h3>Beshbarmak means “Five Fingers” in almost all of the Turkic languages. It used to be a traditional dish for many nomadic ethnicities.<br> Hence, you will find Beshbarmak in almost all of the Central Asian countries. Mainly though, Beshbarmak became a national dish of Kazakhstan. <br>It is known under similar names in the bordering countries. Beshbarmoq, shilpildoq, norin, бешбармак, bishparmak are some of the names these <br> countries have for the dish. Why ‘five fingers’? That’s because the dish was eaten with bare hands and always came with a bowl of soup on a side, <br> called Shurpo. Honestly though, I’ve never eaten this dish with my bare hands. Same goes for Uzbek Palov :)

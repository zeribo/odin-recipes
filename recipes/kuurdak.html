    <p class="description">Kuurdak (куурдак) is a traditional Kyrgyz dish and one of the oldest recipes found in Central Asia. It is eaten throughout  Central Asia and particularly beloved as a national dish in Kyrgyzstan. 

        This stewed meat dish is one of the easiest and simplest recipes to make. Traditionally, the meat used is mutton (lamb),  horse, and/or organ meat cooked in plenty of fat from the animal. Nowadays, you can use whatever meat you like or  have on hand, such as beef or chicken, however, fatty meat works best in this dish as the animal fat coats the meat  and gives the dish it’s most traditional, lovely flavor.
